#### Amazon review helpfulness prediction

Amazon, one of the largest online retailers with millions of products and an active online community, seeks to provide customers with the most helpful reviews for a product of interest. Reviews can be voted on by online shoppers as either helpful or not helpful. I present a model for predicting the ratio of helpful votes out of total votes a review receives. Due to the heavy-tailed reality of Amazon review votes, my model partitions the data into two separate areas and evaluated using mean absolute error.
